          <p>We educate folks on how they can operate a node and

          <p>If you're a business owner it's likely you're already paying
            for internet service. Most businesses use a miniscule amount of the
            bandwidth they have bought. We can help you offer that extra
            bandwidth to your customers while having virtually no impact on your
            existing network and operations.</p>

          <p>As a homeowner or renter you may be interested in
            participating by either sharing your residential network connection
            with your neighbors or connecting to an existing PTP Node as a
            repeater. Your participation in PTP's network helps us to connect
            the city with free WiFi. There is plenty of bandwidth to go
            around.</p>

          <p>We offer node hosts support and equipment and advise them on
            such things as network providers and networking equipment and try
            to be responsive to outages.</p>
